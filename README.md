# terraform-azurerm-avm-res-network-dnsresolver

This is a module for deploying private dns resolver. It can be used to deploy the reosolver, inbound endpoints, outbound endpoints, forwarding rulesets and rules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the overall AVM framework is not GA (generally available) yet - the CI framework and test automation is not fully functional and implemented across all supported languages yet - breaking changes are expected, and additional customer feedback is yet to be gathered and incorporated. Hence, modules **MUST NOT** be published at version `1.0.0` or higher at this time.
>
> All module **MUST** be published as a pre-release version (e.g., `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.2.0`, etc.) until the AVM framework becomes GA.
>
> However, it is important to note that this **DOES NOT** mean that the modules cannot be consumed and utilized. They **CAN** be leveraged in all types of environments (dev, test, prod etc.). Consumers can treat them just like any other IaC module and raise issues or feature requests against them as they learn from the usage of the module. Consumers should also read the release notes for each version, if considering updating to a more recent version of a module to see if there are any considerations or breaking changes etc.

## Features And Notes
- This module deploys a private dns resolver and optional inbound and outbound endpoints.
- It also deploys optional forwarding rulesets and rules for outbound endpoints.
- An existing virtual network with appropriately sized **empty** subnets is required.
- For information on the Azure Private DNS Resolver service, see [Private DNS Resolver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview).
- For information on how to configure subnets for the resolver, see [Inbound Endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview#inbound-endpoints) and [Outbound Endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview#outbound-endpoints).

## Feedback
- Your feedback is welcome! Please raise an issue or feature request on the module's GitHub repository.

  - `principal_type` - (Optional) The type of the `principal_id`. Possible values are `User`, `Group` and `ServicePrincipal`. It is necessary to explicitly set this attribute when creating role assignments if the principal creating the assignment is constrained by ABAC rules that filters on the PrincipalType attribute.
